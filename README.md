You crash land on this planet called Arcaemi, and in your crash, you create a huge crater and end up really deep into the planet. Now, you begin carrying your ship, piece by piece, to the surface to fix it and fly off the planet. At each level you climb, there is a Guardian of the Old One who wants to stop you. You can either talk them out of fighting and onto your side (maybe even flirt with themâ€¦), or kill them!
