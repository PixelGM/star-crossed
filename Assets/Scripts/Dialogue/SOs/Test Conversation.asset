  - "OW! Ah\u2026 shit.\r"
  - "[dusts self off, looks up at the big ass hole]\r"
  - "Ngh\u2026 Fuck my life. "
  - ' *beep beep beep*'
  - 'hello? HELLO? '
  - AH SHIT! I- hello?
  - "IS THAT A NEW CRASHER?? a new face? haven\u2019t seen one of those in a while\u2026
    HEY KID! C\u2019MON O\u2019ER HERE! yeah, what\u2019s your name sugar ;)"
  - '[walks over to the brain halves]'
  - "Deuce\u2026 New crasher? Uh- I guess? Where are YOU? Wait- who are you? Where
    am I?\r\n"
  - "well to start off baby we\u2019re right in front of you ;) YEAH YOU\u2019RE
    RIGHT IN FRONT OF US HOW COULD YOU NOT SEE? "
  - "Are you a brain\u2026 in a jar?"
  - "YES- I AM STUCK IN A JAR WITH- stuck? you? it is a pleasure to be with me! i\u2019m
    stuck with your underdeveloped cerebellum!"
  - WOW. THAT IS UNCALLED FOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE BEEN STUCK WITH YOUR HYPERACTIVE
    HYPOTH-
  - 'My bad, are you two brains in a jar? '
  - "yes. BASICALLY. when you stick with the same half for too long you just can\u2019t
    take it anymore, darling. I SPLIT US RIGHT DOWN THE CORPUS CALLOSUM. so we are
    like, two separate people now."
  - "Okay\u2026 and what is your- are your names?"
  - "oh of course how could i forget pleasantries- my name is\u2026 uh\u2026 hey
    do you remember? "
  - NO I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T INTERRUPT YOU.
  - hmmm. well shit. does it say anything on the container?
  - It looks like it says Knob? Knob on one side Bonk on the other?
  - AH. WHAT A NAME. I AM BONK.
  - hey! who is letting you pick first?
  - "THERE IS NO WAY THAT I AM GONNA BE CALLED \u201CKNOB\u201D."
  - okay fine. whatever. suits a brute like yourself anyway.
  - Okay, so Knob and Bonk, where the hell am I?
  - ARCAEMI.
  - yep! looks like you lucked out by crash landing in the mind-fuck capital of the
    galaxy!
  - "YOU\u2019RE GONNA BE STUCK HERE A WHILE."
  - The- Huh? The fuck does that mean?
  - "YOU\u2019RE UNDER THE OLD ONE NOW!"
  - "basically, he\u2019s some power tripped weirdo who runs this place."
  - " HE DOESN\u2019T LET ANYONE LEAVE."
  - and this place, ARCAEMI, is his sandbox.
  - "What? There is NO SHOT I\u2019m staying in this shit-hole. There\u2019s gotta
    be a way out!"
  - "well\u2026 we have been here for a while and actually have, devised, a strategy\u2026
    we might be willing to share if you promise you take us with you when you escape "
  - WE FUCKING HATE IT HERE!
  - "Uh sure, I want to leave too. So what\u2019s the-"
  - KILL EVERYONE.
  - Kill, what? Who even is-
  - well- i think some of them could be persuaded ;) too, i mean, i doubt anyone
    wants to stay here that much-
  - THE GUARDIANS. THEY ARE IN OUR WAY TO ESCAPE. YOU NEED TO KILL THEM.
  - 'Guardians? '
  - "yes the old one himself enlisted a handful of soldiers at the main entrances
    of this cavern\u2019s mouth to keep schmucks like you and i (and bonk) from escaping,
    and i think you could probably convince ;) them to-"
  - "TO DIE. CONVINCING THEM WITH A GUN. OR OTHER WEAPON.\r"
  - Okay, so there are people standing in my way from escaping? And I need to talk
    to, or kill, them to be able to get out? What about when I am at the surface?
  - "well, when *we* are at the surface\u2026 "
  - "DON\u2019T YOU HAVE A SHIP?"
  - "Uh- looks pretty broken to me, guess thats what happens when you crash into
    the middle of a fucking planet\u2026"
  - Uh- it looks like the main body is still on the surface, but some parts came
    down with me.
  - CARRY THEM TO THE SURFACE, then fix your little spacey ship, AND BLAST US OFF
    THIS ROCK!
  - Okay, that sounds doable. How far from the surface are we now?
  - "well sweetheart, right now we are at rock bottom. THE LOWEST OF THE LOW. i would
    guess you need to climb around\u2026 four layers? THIS IS A VERY DEEP CAVERN."
  - "So, carry the ship parts, climb five layers, defeat or \u201Cconvince\u201D
    the guardians, then blast off?"
  - 'YES. basically. '
  - "That doesn\u2019t sound too bad\u2026 And I am known for my charm\u2026\r\nAre
    the guardians hot?\r\n"
  - ...
  - "Nevermind- if they aren\u2019t I still got my weapons on me. Guess I\u2019m
    off then?"
  - "hmmm\u2026 darling you think you\u2019ll leave before\u2026 practising ;)"
  - "YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE. YOU\u2019RE NOT LEAVING UNTIL WE TRAIN YOU."
  - I- fine. What do you need me to do?
  - "well\u2026"
  - BATTLE START!
